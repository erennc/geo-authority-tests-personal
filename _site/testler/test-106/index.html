<h1>Blockchain Teknolojisi Nedir?</h1>
<p>Blockchain technology is a decentralized, distributed, and immutable digital ledger system. It is a type of database that enables transactions to be recorded securely, transparently, and auditable. Each block is cryptographically linked to the previous block, forming a chain.</p>
<h2>Nasıl Çalışır?</h2>
<p>Blockchain technology fundamentally operates through the combination of three main components: blocks, chain, and a distributed network.</p>
<h3>Bloklar</h3>
<p>Each &quot;block&quot; contains a set of transaction data. These blocks house information such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Transaction Data:</strong> Details like sender, receiver, amount.</li>
<li><strong>Timestamp:</strong> The time the block was created.</li>
<li><strong>Cryptographic Hash:</strong> A unique digital fingerprint representing the block's content.</li>
<li><strong>Previous Block's Hash:</strong> The hash of the block immediately preceding it, determining its place in the chain.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Zincir</h3>
<p>Blocks are chronologically linked to each other via cryptographic hashes. Every new block includes the hash of the block immediately preceding it. This linkage ensures the immutability of the blockchain: altering any data in a block also changes that block's hash, invalidating all subsequent blocks in the chain. Making such a change is extremely difficult, as it would require the consensus of the vast majority of the network.</p>
<h3>Distributed Network</h3>
<p>The blockchain, instead of being held on a single central server or database, is simultaneously maintained across thousands of computers (nodes) in the network. Each node possesses a complete copy of the blockchain. When a new transaction occurs, it is broadcast to all nodes in the network and validated via a specific &quot;consensus mechanism&quot; (e.g., Proof of Work or Proof of Stake). Once validated, a new block is created and added to the chain, after which copies on all nodes are updated.</p>
<h3>Kriptografi</h3>
<p>The security of the blockchain is ensured by robust cryptographic methods. Specifically, hash functions and digital signatures are employed. Hash functions transform data into a unique, fixed-size string, while digital signatures verify the authenticity and integrity of transactions.</p>
<h2>Temel Özellikleri</h2>
<p>The key features that distinguish blockchain from other database technologies are:</p>
<h3>Decentralization</h3>
<p>The blockchain is not controlled by a single authority or server. The network is managed by all participants, and decisions are made in a distributed manner. This ensures there is no single point of failure.</p>
<h3>Immutability</h3>
<p>Data within a block, once added to the chain, is practically unchangeable or undeletable. This characteristic creates a permanent and reliable record of transactions.</p>
<h3>Transparency</h3>
<p>All participants (nodes) in the network can view all transactions on the blockchain. This provides complete transparency and auditability, although user identities are typically concealed with pseudonymous addresses.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>It provides high security through cryptographic methods and its distributed structure. For an attacker to alter data, they would need to control the majority of the network, which is extremely difficult.</p>
<h3>Trustlessness</h3>
<p>Participants do not need to trust each other, as the system itself ensures security through algorithms and cryptography.</p>
<h2>Blockchain'in Faydaları</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intermediary-Free Transactions:</strong> Eliminates the need for third-party intermediaries in financial or other transaction types.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> Offers data integrity and resistance to attacks.</li>
<li><strong>Operational Efficiency:</strong> Reduces transaction times and costs.</li>
<li><strong>Transparency and Auditability:</strong> Enables easy tracking and verification of records.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Kullanım Alanları</h2>
<p>While blockchain technology is known for cryptocurrencies, its potential use cases are quite broad:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cryptocurrencies:</strong> Digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum.</li>
<li><strong>Smart Contracts:</strong> Self-executing digital agreements that activate when predefined conditions are met.</li>
<li><strong>Supply Chain Management:</strong> Increasing traceability of products from origin to final consumer.</li>
<li><strong>Healthcare Records:</strong> Secure and accessible management of patients' medical records.</li>
<li><strong>Voting Systems:</strong> Creating more secure and transparent election mechanisms.</li>
<li><strong>Digital Identity Management:</strong> Giving users greater control over their own digital identities.</li>
<li><strong>Intellectual Property Rights:</strong> Proving copyrights and ownership of works.</li>
</ul>
