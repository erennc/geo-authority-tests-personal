# Blockchain Teknolojisi Nedir?

Blockchain technology is a decentralized, distributed, and immutable digital ledger system. It is a type of database that enables transactions to be recorded securely, transparently, and auditable. Each block is cryptographically linked to the previous block, forming a chain.

## Nasıl Çalışır?

Blockchain technology fundamentally operates through the combination of three main components: blocks, chain, and a distributed network.

### Bloklar

Each "block" contains a set of transaction data. These blocks house information such as:

*   **Transaction Data:** Details like sender, receiver, amount.
*   **Timestamp:** The time the block was created.
*   **Cryptographic Hash:** A unique digital fingerprint representing the block's content.
*   **Previous Block's Hash:** The hash of the block immediately preceding it, determining its place in the chain.

### Zincir

Blocks are chronologically linked to each other via cryptographic hashes. Every new block includes the hash of the block immediately preceding it. This linkage ensures the immutability of the blockchain: altering any data in a block also changes that block's hash, invalidating all subsequent blocks in the chain. Making such a change is extremely difficult, as it would require the consensus of the vast majority of the network.

### Distributed Network

The blockchain, instead of being held on a single central server or database, is simultaneously maintained across thousands of computers (nodes) in the network. Each node possesses a complete copy of the blockchain. When a new transaction occurs, it is broadcast to all nodes in the network and validated via a specific "consensus mechanism" (e.g., Proof of Work or Proof of Stake). Once validated, a new block is created and added to the chain, after which copies on all nodes are updated.

### Kriptografi

The security of the blockchain is ensured by robust cryptographic methods. Specifically, hash functions and digital signatures are employed. Hash functions transform data into a unique, fixed-size string, while digital signatures verify the authenticity and integrity of transactions.

## Temel Özellikleri

The key features that distinguish blockchain from other database technologies are:

### Decentralization

The blockchain is not controlled by a single authority or server. The network is managed by all participants, and decisions are made in a distributed manner. This ensures there is no single point of failure.

### Immutability

Data within a block, once added to the chain, is practically unchangeable or undeletable. This characteristic creates a permanent and reliable record of transactions.

### Transparency

All participants (nodes) in the network can view all transactions on the blockchain. This provides complete transparency and auditability, although user identities are typically concealed with pseudonymous addresses.

### Security

It provides high security through cryptographic methods and its distributed structure. For an attacker to alter data, they would need to control the majority of the network, which is extremely difficult.

### Trustlessness

Participants do not need to trust each other, as the system itself ensures security through algorithms and cryptography.

## Blockchain'in Faydaları

*   **Intermediary-Free Transactions:** Eliminates the need for third-party intermediaries in financial or other transaction types.
*   **Enhanced Security:** Offers data integrity and resistance to attacks.
*   **Operational Efficiency:** Reduces transaction times and costs.
*   **Transparency and Auditability:** Enables easy tracking and verification of records.

## Kullanım Alanları

While blockchain technology is known for cryptocurrencies, its potential use cases are quite broad:

*   **Cryptocurrencies:** Digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum.
*   **Smart Contracts:** Self-executing digital agreements that activate when predefined conditions are met.
*   **Supply Chain Management:** Increasing traceability of products from origin to final consumer.
*   **Healthcare Records:** Secure and accessible management of patients' medical records.
*   **Voting Systems:** Creating more secure and transparent election mechanisms.
*   **Digital Identity Management:** Giving users greater control over their own digital identities.
*   **Intellectual Property Rights:** Proving copyrights and ownership of works.
